### üöÄ The 29-Day Journey: From Silence to Symphony

This project is a testament to rapid, iterative development. Here‚Äôs how Vaani AI came to life, week by week.

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Unfold the Development Chronicle</strong></summary>

* **üå± Week 1 (Days 1-7): The Spark of Life.** The initial focus was on the fundamentals: giving Vaani a voice and ears. We established the core audio pipeline, capturing microphone input and generating speech. The week culminated in a magical moment: the first successful, end-to-end conversation where Vaani listened to a sentence and spoke a response.

* **üß† Week 2 (Days 8-15): The Dawn of Intelligence.** This week, we gave Vaani a mind. By integrating a state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM), Vaani transitioned from a simple script to a thinking entity. We meticulously crafted its system prompt to define its personality‚Äîhelpful, concise, and professional‚Äîand implemented conversational memory to maintain context.

* **üëÇ Week 3 (Days 16-22): Achieving Awareness.** To make Vaani a true assistant, it needed to be present but unobtrusive. We integrated a low-resource wake word engine ("Hey, Vaani"), allowing it to listen passively. This week was a deep dive into optimization, relentlessly tuning the system to minimize latency for fluid, real-time interactions.

* **üõ†Ô∏è Week 4 (Days 23-29): Granting Superpowers.** The final and most transformative week. We unlocked Vaani's ability to act in the real world through **Function Calling**. This powerful technique allows the LLM to request the execution of custom Python code, enabling Vaani to connect to external APIs and perform meaningful tasks. This is where Vaani learned to check the weather in Indore, manage my Google Calendar, and more.

### ‚ú® Core Capabilities

* **üó£Ô∏è Fluid Conversation:** Employs cutting-edge STT and TTS engines for interactions that feel natural and immediate.
* **üß† Context-Aware Intelligence:** Leverages a powerful LLM to understand nuances, recall previous parts of the conversation, and provide insightful responses.
* **üëÇ Always-On Wake Word:** Stays dormant until called with "Hey, Vaani," ensuring privacy and responsiveness.
* **üé≠ Customizable Persona:** Vaani's personality can be easily sculpted via the main system prompt, from a formal assistant to a witty companion.

### üîß Advanced Integrations (The "Superpowers")

Vaani uses a "toolbelt" of functions to interact with the outside world:

* **üå¶Ô∏è Real-Time Meteorologist:** Connects to live weather APIs.
    * *Example: "Hey Vaani, will I need an umbrella for my evening walk in Indore?"*
* **üìÖ Proactive Calendar Assistant:** Integrates directly with Google Calendar API.
    * *Example: "Hey Vaani, add 'Project discussion with the team' to my calendar for tomorrow at 4 PM."*
* **üí° Smart Home Conductor (Optional):** Designed to be extensible for APIs like Philips Hue or Home Assistant.
    * *Example: "Hey Vaani, dim the study lights to 50%."*
